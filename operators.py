# We have built in methods available in python that give us boolean outcomes as well

# greetings = "Hello World!"
# H E L L O   W O R L D  !
# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

#To find out the length of characters in the string, we use the method len()
print(len(greetings))

Example_text = "Here's some text with lot's of text"
# counts words that appear more than once
print(Example_text.count("text")) # counts how many times 'text' is written in the string stored in example_text

print(Example_text.lower()) # changes the string to lower case
print(Example_text.upper()) # changes the string to upper case
print(Example_text.capitalize()) # changes the first letter to a capital letter

# Concatenation - combining values, variables, strings together

First_Name = "James"
Last_Name ="Bond"
age = "99"
# print(First_Name)
# print(Last_Name)

# There are two ways of concatenating
# Using the style below
print(First_Name + " " + Last_Name + " " + str(age))

# or you can do the formatting method:
print(f"{First_Name} {Last_Name} is {age} old")

# str() is the method that converts integer value into string
#
# Casting - casting string into int or int into string

print(type(str(age)))
# Now the output will class age as a string because it has been converted

# Activity: Find the method to cast string into integer and display the value and the type after conversion

print(int(age))
print(First_Name + " " + Last_Name + " " + age)
# Note: you cannot concatenate different variables e.g string with an integer
print(type(int(age)))
